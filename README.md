# SimpleADBBackup
A noob-friendly GUI to Android's native backup function.

Simple ADB Backup backs up the complete data of Android smartphones and tablets to PCs. A single click suffices. 
It supports Android versions 4.0 and above. A root access is not required. 

Simple ADB Backup provides multiple backup options. 
A restore function is included to make a disaster recovery. 

Thus, the Android users can create the backup with or without system apps or copy the entire data from the memory card to their computers. 

We recommend above all the choice "Backup all without system apps", However, ADB Simple Backup does not get along with all Android smartphones and tablets. 
Some devices are not supported.

Simple ADB Backup is the work of XDA developer omegavesko, who's released it for free.
