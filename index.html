        <h1>Holo Backup</h1>

<p>Holo Backup is a simple, beautiful, user-friendly interface to Android's native backup function. Because the functionality is entirely included in the OS, it doesn't require your phone/tablet to be rooted for the backup to work. This is very useful, because making a backup is something you should always do before modifying your device - and, in some cases, the act of modifying the device <strong>will</strong> wipe it, so you can either make a backup or lose it all.</p>

<p>Because this functionality was only introduced fairly recently (in Android 4.0), it will only work on Android 4.0 and up. Most devices made in late 2011 or later have 4.0, so most people needn't worry about whether it will work or not.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=36499906">XDA thread</a>.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Windows users can simply run HoloBackup.exe. No extra messing around necessary.</p>

<p>Linux users can just run the HoloBackupLinux binary. It will ask for root permissions using gksudo when it needs them - Or not at all, if you've set up adb properly and ticked the 'system adb binary' checkbox.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

  <p>- NEW: Proper icon on the Windows executable.</p>

  <p>- NEW: The ability to use an existing adb install on Linux.</p>

  <p>- NEW: Text message and call log backup. This uses SMS Backup+, and excellent open-source project by Jan Berkel.</p>

  <p>- NEW: You can now donate bitcoins! This is more of a fun feature than anything, I don't really expect to make a profit here.</p>

  <p>- NEW: Wireless ADB support has been added! You can now natively connect to your device wirelessly, provided you've enabled wireless ADB on your device using an app or a custom ROM. Note though, this requires your device to be rooted.</p>

  <p>- All of ADB backup's features are supported, save for single app backup, which I've removed because it very rarely worked. You can see all the operations listed in the screenshot below.</p>

  <p>- Gorgeous Holo-inspired design.</p>

  <p>- You can set a custom directory to save backups to. By default, it'll save backups to the /Backups/ folder.</p>
