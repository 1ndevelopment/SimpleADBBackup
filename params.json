{"body":"# Holo Backup\r\n\r\nHolo Backup is a simple, beautiful, user-friendly interface to Android's native backup function. Because the functionality is entirely included in the OS, it doesn't require your phone/tablet to be rooted for the backup to work. This is very useful, because making a backup is something you should always do before modifying your device - and, in some cases, the act of modifying the device **will** wipe it, so you can either make a backup or lose it all.\r\n\r\nBecause this functionality was only introduced fairly recently (in Android 4.0), it will only work on Android 4.0 and up. Most devices made in late 2011 or later have 4.0, so most people needn't worry about whether it will work or not.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found in the [XDA thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=36499906).\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Windows Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/pC2AmUe.png)","tagline":"A beautiful interface to Android's native backup function.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
